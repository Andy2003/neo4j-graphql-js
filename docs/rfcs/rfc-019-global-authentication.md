# Global authentication

## Problem

For some use cases the GraphQL API needs to be secured globally, on the top most level. This would allow or prevent any querying of the API as a whole.

Outside of GraphQL:

## Proposed Solution

-   config boolean
-   directive?
-   check the user token

enable authentication on the root query type. By providing no role or policy names weâ€™re simply saying the user must be authenticated.

### Usage Examples

## Risks

What risks might cause us to go over the appetite described above?

### Security consideration

Please take some time to think about potential security issues/considerations for the proposed solution.
For example: How can a malicious user abuse this? How can we prevent that in such case?

## Out of Scope

What are we definitely not going to implement in this solution?
