= Apollo Federation

WARNING: Apollo Federation is currently experimental. There will be missing functionality, and breaking changes may occur in patch and minor releases. It is not recommended to use it in a production environment.

The Neo4j GraphQL Library can be used to generate a subgraph schema to be used as a part of a federated supergraph using https://www.apollographql.com/apollo-federation/[Apollo Federation].

== Usage

This section will walk through setting up some example subgraphs using the Neo4j GraphQL Library, and composing them into a supergraph schema.

=== Prerequisites

Install Rover from Apollo by following their https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/getting-started[installation instructions].

The example subgraphs below assume that the database URI is stored in an environment variable "NEO4J_URI", and the password in "NEO4J_PASSWORD".

=== Example subgraphs

=== Supergraph composition

Create a new file, `supergraph.yaml`

[source, yaml, indent=0]
----
federation_version: 2
subgraphs:
  locations:
    routing_url: http://localhost:4001/
    schema:
      subgraph_url: http://localhost:4001/
  reviews:
    routing_url: http://localhost:4002/
    schema:
      subgraph_url: http://localhost:4002/
----

In the same directory, execute the following command to generate the supergraph schema:

[source, bash, indent=0]
----
rover supergraph compose --config supergraph.yaml > supergraph.graphql
----

Finally, execute the following commands to download Apollo Router and start the supergraph server:

[source, bash, indent=0]
----
curl -sSL https://router.apollo.dev/download/nix/latest | sh
./router --dev --supergraph supergraph.graphql
----

You should now be able to navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4000/ in a web browser to access Apollo Sandbox and query the supergraph.
