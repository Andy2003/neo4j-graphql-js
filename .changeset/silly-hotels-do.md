"@neo4j/graphql": patch

Add feature option `excludeDeprecatedFields` to reduce the schema size by removing autogenerated fields that have been deprecated:

Usage:

```js
const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({
    typeDefs,
    driver,
    features: {
        excludeDeprecatedFields: true,
    },
});
```

This flag will remove the fields marked as `@deprecated` that have been autogenerated by the `@neo4j/graphql` library to reduce the schema size and hence server startup time and performance. Note that user-defined deprecated fields are not removed. Some autogenerated fields may still be generated, particularly those that do not affect schema size.
